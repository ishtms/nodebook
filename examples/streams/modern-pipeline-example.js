/**
 * Modern Pipeline (Promise-based) Example
 *
 * The best way to work with streams in modern Node.js.
 * Import pipeline from 'node:stream/promises' to get Promise version.
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Works with async/await
 * - Clean error handling with try/catch
 * - No callbacks
 * - Still gets all pipeline() benefits (auto cleanup, error propagation)
 *
 * This is the recommended approach for new code.
