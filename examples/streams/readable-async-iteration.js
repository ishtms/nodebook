/**
 * Readable Stream - Async Iteration Example
 *
 * The cleanest way to consume readable streams in modern Node.js.
 * Every readable stream is an async iterable, so you can use for await...of
 *
 * Why this is better:
 * - Clean, readable code
 * - Automatic error handling with try/catch
 * - Respects backpressure automatically
 * - No manual event listeners needed
 *
 * This is the recommended approach for most use cases.
