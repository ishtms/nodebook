/**
 * Readable Stream - Flowing Mode Example
 *
 * In flowing mode, the stream pushes data to you automatically.
 * You just listen for 'data' events and handle chunks as they arrive.
 *
 * Key points:
 * - Adding a 'data' listener automatically switches stream to flowing mode
 * - Stream pushes data to you as fast as it can read it
 * - You don't call .read() - data comes to you
 * - Risk: if source is faster than you can process, could cause issues (backpressure handles this)
 *
 * This is simpler than paused mode, but less control.

// Data will be pushed to us - we don't ask for it

// 'end' still tells us when we're done

  console.log("--> Reached end of stream.");

// Always handle errors
readableStream.on("error", (err) => {
