/**
 * Writable Stream - Backpressure Example
 *
 * Shows how to properly handle backpressure when writing to a stream.
 *
 * The Problem:
 * - If you write faster than the destination can handle, data buffers in memory
 * - This can cause your app to run out of memory and crash
 *
 * The Solution:
 * - .write() returns false when the internal buffer is full
 * - Stop writing when you get false
 * - Wait for the 'drain' event to resume writing
 *
 * This is critical for production apps. Ignoring backpressure = memory leaks.
